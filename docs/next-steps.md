# Next Steps


## Local Development

I **highly** recommend installing a GitHub tool and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to make edits to the repo locally. 

* [Install GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)
* [Install Visual Studio Code (my preferred IDE)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

VSCode also [has some great features for managing Git](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview).
These aren't necessary, you can also just use Git from the command line and a text editor (but don't do that to yourself).

This will allow you to edit/remove/add multiple pages at once.

## Local Deployment

It is also **super** convenient to be able to run the website locally to make sure it is all working correctly *before* you commit big changes.

The al-folio repository [has information on local setups](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/INSTALL.md#local-setup-on-windows), but I personally only have experience with the Legacy option.

## Additional Features

The [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/) repo has lots of great documentation (including the README) describing its features, definitely check it out.
